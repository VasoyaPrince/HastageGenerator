+ Average hashtags are also trending hashtags on Instagram, but they are used less often. As a rule, they have a narrower focus. By using them, you significantly increase your chances of maximum and long-term organic growth of your account.


+ Rare hashtags are niche hashtags, branded hashtags, or average hashtags with the location marked or a clear indication of the service/product. Competition is low, and coverage is smaller but maximally targeted. Using rare hashtags will not bring fast and significant account growth, but will provide the maximum long-lasting effect.


You need to not only use different hashtags and regularly change them, but also make completely different groups of hashtags. We advise our clients to use 1-4 popular hashtags, 10-15 average hashtags, and around 5-10 rare hashtags.


Please use relevant hashtags. Give your future followers a chance to find you quickly.
